# Unibo - Artificial Intelligence Notes

These are personal notes of the Artificial Intelligence master's degree courses at Unibo (Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna). The repository contains a folder for every single course I have been able to take notes on. If some courses have not been listed, it is because I have not taken notes on those. In particular, the following table shows the current status of the notes related to the various courses:

Course  | Year | Status
------- | ---- | ------
Deep Learning | 1 | Completed
Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation | 1 | Completed
Image Processing and Computer Vision | 1 | Completed
Languages and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence | 1 | Completed
Machine Learning | 1 | Completed
Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Artificial Intelligence | 1 | Completed
Artificial Intelligence in Industry | 2 | In progress
Ethics in Artificial Intelligence | 2 | In progress
Machine Learning for Computer Vision | 2 | Completed*
Natural Language Processing | 2 | Completed*
Social Network Analysis | 2 | Completed

*The notes for these courses were completed using slides and other material provided in the previous academic year (2021/2022). Therefore, these notes will be modified during the course of the current academic year, based on new slides, lectures and material.
